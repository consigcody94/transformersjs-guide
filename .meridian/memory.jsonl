Published open-source MIT-licensed project ready for community contributions. **Pattern:** Comprehensive guide repository structure: (1) README as complete overview with features/quick-start/examples/resources, (2) docs/ organized by audience (getting-started/, tutorials/, guides/ by domain, integrations/ by framework, api-reference/), (3) examples/ with working HTML+JS demos organized by modality, (4) starter-template/ with framework-specific boilerplates (vanilla-js complete, react/nextjs/vue/nodejs structured), (5) demo-app/ for all-in-one showcase. Each example includes: working code, README with explanations, performance notes, troubleshooting. Key deliverables: Installation guide (CDN/NPM/Node.js), Quick-start guide (5-min to first model), Sentiment analysis example (production UI), Vanilla JS starter (Vite+ES modules), Contributing guidelines. Researched via WebSearch: Transformers.js v3 WebGPU capabilities, model ecosystem, browser support (70%), performance benchmarks.", "tags": ["documentation", "pattern", "ai", "transformers.js", "open-source", "repository-structure", "guide", "webai"], "links": ["https://github.com/consigcody94/transformersjs-guide", "~/transformersjs-guide", "https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers.js", "https://huggingface.co/blog/transformersjs-v3"]}
